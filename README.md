The logic of the code revolves around the stack where I used a gif background and stacked it against the randomized dice. The dice was under the expanded widget in which it holds its original animation but I included a roll or reset button. The roll button calls a randomized dice value for both dice and the total dice roll is being recorded which can be reset by the reset button. For the title, I did an animation using the animation text kit import which makes the title rotating infinitely.
